# An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.
# An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values.
# Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol, which consist of the methods __iter__() and __next__().
# ---
# Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all iterable objects. They are iterable containers which you can get an iterator from.
# All these objects have a iter() method which is used to get an iterator:

mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
myit = iter(mytuple)

print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))

# Create an Iterator
# To create an object/class as an iterator you have to implement the methods __iter__() and __next__() to your object.
# The __iter__() method acts similar, you can do operations (initializing etc.), but must always return the iterator object itself.
# The __next__() method also allows you to do operations, and must return the next item in the sequence.

class MyNumbers:
  def __iter__(self):
    self.a = 1
    return self

  def __next__(self):
    x = self.a
    self.a += 1
    return x

myclass = MyNumbers()
myiter = iter(myclass)

print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))

# To prevent the iteration to go on forever, we can use the StopIteration statement.
class MyNumbers:
  def __iter__(self):
    self.a = 1
    return self

  def __next__(self):
    if self.a <= 20:
      x = self.a
      self.a += 1
      return x
    else:
      raise StopIteration

myclass = MyNumbers()
myiter = iter(myclass)
